# PSEncrypt 

This question was given in the Grande Finale of Digital Pakistan Cybersecurity Hackathon 2022. It belonged to Network Security Category and had 100 points.

We were given a pcap file named file.pcapng. Lets open it in Wireshark.

We are given 3508 packets to analyze. Lets filter it out using by

File >> Export Objects >> HTTP

We get a pop-up with the filtered HTTP object list. We save them all in a folder. Our Wireshark task is completed.

Here we are given a host.ps1 (PowerShell file) contains the encrypt and decrypt functions and other parameters.

We are missing one element in the Decrypt-String which we found in the razor(48) file saved in the same folder. It is a base64 string‚Äù IN3DZMA9y5D0q5y4Pe3Uv%2FVE3mA4EZY55XHJJIdLc29WAK73bE2DzB7ae%2Fmpy4CW‚Äù

Install powershell on linux using command

`apt install powershell`

Open the file host.ps1 and delete the last two call to functions and replace it with 

`Decrypt-String $key "IN3DZMA9y5D0q5y4Pe3Uv/VE3mA4EZY55XHJJIdLc29WAK73bE2DzB7ae/mpy4CW‚Äù`

Save the file and execute on linux.

`pwsh host.ps1`

We have the flag üòé

`flag: flag{**_****_Chi11}`
